# Neural Network Uncertinaty Calibration for Inverse Reinforcement Learning
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of uncertainty estimates of multiple Bayesian Neural Networks technique calibrated for the Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem. 
## Done
- Linear IRL model numPy
- Linear IRL model pyTorch
- Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Ensemble Neural Network
- Gridworld benchmark
- Objectworld benchmark
- Calibrate NN uncertainty estimates through ensemble methods
- ClearML config

## ToDo
- Calbirate uncertainty via Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian
- Visualise Objectworld results
- Extensive hyperparam search for 64, 256 & 1024 state worlds
- Introduce noise to experimentally validate uncertainty calibrations
