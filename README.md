# GNN vs GP Uncertainty Calibration in Inverse Reinforcement Learning 
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of uncertainty estimates in Bayesian Neural Networks vs Gaussian Processes for Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem. To do this I will use both models to solve 3 inverse reinforcement learning benchmark problems: Gridworld, Objectworld and my newly Hidden State Benchmark.

## Done
- Linear IRL model numPy
- Linear IRL model pyTorch
- Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Ensemble Neural Network
- Gridworld benchmark
- Objectworld benchmark

## ToDo
- Linear IRL w/ Gaussian Process
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Gaussian Process
- Bayesian Neural Network using variational weights method
- Hidden state benchmark
