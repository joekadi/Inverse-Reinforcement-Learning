# Evaluating Uncertainty Estimation Methods For Deep Neural Networkâ€™s In Inverse Reinforcement Learning
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of epistemic uncertainty estimates from multiple Deep Neural Network reguliarsation techniques on the Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem. 

## Running Instructions

### Setup

In every overwrite change sys.path[0] = "/Users/MSci-Project/pyTorch/" to path of cloned directory
This will ensure all relative and absolute imports find correc paths

To create conda virtualenv from requirements:

$ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

### Running

$ python
