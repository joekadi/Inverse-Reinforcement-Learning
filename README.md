# Neural Network Uncertinaty Calibration for Inverse Reinforcement Learning
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of uncertainty estimates of multiple Bayesian Neural Networks technique calibrated for the Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem. 
## Done
- Linear IRL model numPy
- Linear IRL model pyTorch
- Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Ensemble Neural Network
- Gridworld benchmark
- Objectworld benchmark

## ToDo
- Visualise Objectworld results
- Calibrate NN uncertainty estimates x3 methods
- Build experimental methods to evaluate quality of uncertainty estimates
- Build all visualisations
- Evaluate
