# Evaluating Uncertainty Estimation Methods For Deep Neural Networkâ€™s In Inverse Reinforcement Learning
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of epistemic uncertainty estimates from multiple Deep Neural Network reguliarsation techniques on the Inverse Reinforcement Learning problem.
