# GNN vs GP Uncertainty Calibration in Inverse Reinforcement Learning 
This is part of my Computing Science Level 5 MSci Project @ Glasgow University where I compare the quality of uncertainty estimates in Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes for Invere Reinforcement Learning problem.

## Done
- Linear IRL model numPy
- Linear IRL model pyTorch
- Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Neural Network
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Bayesian Neural Network

## ToDo
- Linear IRL w/ Gaussian Process
- Non-Linear IRL w/ Gaussian Process
- Bayesian Neural Network using variational weights method
- Evaluate models on ObjectWorld
- Evaluate models on hidden state benchmark
